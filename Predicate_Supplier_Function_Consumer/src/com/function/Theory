Function ** ->

1)It takes one input, perform some operations and second input is of result type.
2)interface Function<T,R>{

R apply(T t ){ }

}

T -> input type, R -> result type
3)It has compose() operation.
4)It has two function chaining:


F1 & F2

F1.andThen(F2)  -> first F1 will be applied followed by F2
F1.compose(F2)  -> first F2 will be applied followed by F1
